Parser for some infamous Russian synonym dictionary

## About
The work is done as a part of VerbNet project developed at *Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Philology department, master's programme Computational Linguistics* (https://www.hse.ru/en/ma/ling/) For further information on the project, visit http://web-corpora.net/wsgi3/ru-verbs/

### What's that?
We're making a [Princeton](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)-like lexicon of Russian verbs. As we are set to get the best of both data-driven and lexicography-based approaches, we use one infamous Russian synonym dictionary as both point of reference for what we mine and a source of synsets. As such, we needed a smart parser for it.
