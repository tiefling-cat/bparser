    "When I was younger and less pythonic as I am now, I've made a python module to parse babenko synonym dictionary and extract verb classes and synsets from there. The trick was that one couldn't utilise the power of xml.etree as the xml representing the dictionary was broken and had somewhat irregular structure. As such, I parsed it as plain text using regular expressions, patches, crutches, and some profanity. The structure of the module is somewhat complicated, so I created this ipython/jupyter notebook to serve as part-interface, part-userguide to that module. "
